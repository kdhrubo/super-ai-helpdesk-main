Now consider the following accepted articles :

{articles}

Witg all that in mind, and considering all of the accepted ideas, I want to have 2 articles published
every week. Consider today's date as {today}. Give me a proposed schedule for the publication of each article.
Consider {start_date} as the start date for first article.
Generate a table with that schedule.

{format}.

Make sure that the table includes all of the accepted ideas
for the titles. I need it to be a complete list. DO NOT SKIP ANY TITLE IN YOUR RESPONSE UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES. I need it to be a
complete response with a complete list being provied. It's ok that it's long.
